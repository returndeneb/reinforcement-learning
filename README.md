Comments on Jack's Car Rental

I don't think it is proper example for students.
If They just code the problem as they learned , It may takes several hours to get the results.
And there are lots of things to consider.
It takes several days for me to get the same results as example.

You should initially make a table of 21x21x21x21 data of the probability of trasition,
of rental and return for location 1 and 2 each
which reduce training time to about 2 minute (in M1 macbook)
